<h3>Unisex Garment-Dyed T-shirt</h3>
<p>
  The soft-washed, garment-dyed fabric brings extra coziness to your wardrobe while the relaxed fit makes it an excellent daily choice. The double-needle stitching throughout the tee makes it highly durable while the
  lack of side-seams helps the shirt retain its tubular shape.
